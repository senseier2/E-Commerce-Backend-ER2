## Installation
    Download the E-Commerce repository including the mySql database. Seed the database using the command "npm run seeds" this will automatically create the required tables, and populate the tables with the seed data. You will find customizable seed files in the "seeds" folder located in the main directory.

    Remember to install the dependencies with "npm i"

    And finally start the server by running the command "npm start"
    This will start the backend for testing.  Front end development is required for user facing testing.

## Usage
    You can use this E-Commerce backend to track inventory and product information. furthermore with some development this can be used with a POS system to maintain a transactional inventory record as well.
